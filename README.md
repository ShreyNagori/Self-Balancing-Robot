#**Self Balancing Robot using Arduino**
This project is about building a self-balancing robot using an Arduino microcontroller board. The robot uses an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor to measure its orientation and balance itself. The robot also uses a motor driver to control the motors to maintain balance.

Components Required
Arduino Uno or similar microcontroller board
MPU6050 IMU sensor
L298N motor driver
Two DC motors with wheels
9V battery or similar power supply
Breadboard or perfboard
Jumper wires
Chassis or frame to mount the robot

Instructions
Connect the MPU6050 sensor to the Arduino board as shown in the circuit diagram.
Connect the L298N motor driver to the Arduino board as shown in the circuit diagram.
Connect the DC motors to the motor driver.
Mount the components on the chassis or frame.
Upload the code to the Arduino board.
Power on the robot and watch it balance.
